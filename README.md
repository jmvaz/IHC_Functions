# IHC_Functions
Custom IHC visual functions

## Blinds function with state reporting
  - in order to work please adjust on settings:
    - Full time needed to open the blind
    - The previous time divided by 9 (sadly IHC only is able to sum and substract, that why we need to insert the time divided manually)
    - Step timer if you want different than 5 sec
